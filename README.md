The package was developed to execute SQL commands in an interactive way, package composed of SqlKata for generation of SQL and Dapper for execution of SQL that were generated by SqlKata.

The base class of the Canducci SqlKata Dapper generates the SQL and then executes them with methods that relate and join the facility in writing SQL plus execution itself.

This package follows the same trend in the generation of SqlKata that for the moment generates SQL for three types of database manager systems that are: MySQL, Postgresql and SqlServer.
